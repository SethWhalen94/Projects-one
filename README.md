# Projects-one
summer projects

update 09/04/2018:
I have added all the Raspberry Pi projects I have done using code from Freenove.com along with their RFID reader kit
that came with the hardware for all projects in the "Raspberry Pi Projects" folder. I have also included a schematic
photo for each projects which was also from Freenove.com. If you wish to purchase the RFID starter kit, I have
included the link below.

Enjoy!
